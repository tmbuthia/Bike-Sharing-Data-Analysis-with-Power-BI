# Bike-Sharing-Data-Analysis-with-Power-BI
This project showcases an interactive dashboard built in Power BI for analyzing bike-sharing data. The dashboard provides insights into bike usage patterns, customer demographics, and operational trends, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.
### Features
1. Interactive Visuals that drill-down capabilities for exploring detailed bike usage trends.
2. Comprehensive Metrics that includes ride durations, peak usage times, popular bike stations, and customer segmentation.
3. Data Cleaning demonstrates data transformation techniques to handle missing values and inconsistencies.

### Dataset
The dataset contains information about bike-sharing trips, including:
  1. Trip Details: Start and end times, durations, and locations.
  2. User Demographics: Rider type (e.g., casual vs. subscriber) and customer age.
  3. Operational Data: Bike station usage and availability.
#### Tools and Techniques
1. Power BI: Used for data visualization and dashboard creation.
2. Power Query: For cleaning and transforming the raw data.
3. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating calculated columns and measures.
#### Dashboard Highlights
1. Usage Trends: Visualize bike usage over time and identify peak hours and seasons.
2. Customer Segmentation: Analyze the behavior of casual riders versus subscribers.
3. Geospatial Analysis: Interactive maps to explore popular stations and routes.
4. KPIs: Key performance indicators such as total trips, average duration, and revenue estimates.

#### How to Recreate the Dashboard
#### Data Preparation:
1. Import the dataset into Power BI.
2. Use Power Query to clean and format the data.
#### Data Modeling:
1. Establish relationships between tables (if multiple datasets are used).
2. Create calculated columns and measures using DAX.
#### Visualizations:
1. Add visuals such as bar charts, line graphs, and maps.
2. Use slicers and filters for interactivity.
3. Format the dashboard with a consistent theme.
4. Publish the report to Power BI Service for sharing.
### Applications
This analysis can be applied to:
1. Operations Management: Optimize bike station placement and inventory.
2. Marketing: Develop targeted campaigns for different customer segments.
3. Urban Planning: Support decisions on bike lane expansions and infrastructure improvements.
